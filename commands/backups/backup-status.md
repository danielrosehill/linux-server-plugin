Check the status of backup operations on this server:

1. Navigate to ~/backups directory
2. Check for recent backup logs and completion timestamps
3. Identify any failed backup jobs from logs
4. Check disk space used by backups
5. Review the backup orchestrator service status if running as a service
6. Check for any stale backup files (very old without updates)

Provide Daniel with:
- Status of recent backup operations (success/failure)
- Any backup jobs that haven't completed recently
- Disk space consumed by backups
- Recommendations for any issues found
- Oldest and newest backup timestamps
