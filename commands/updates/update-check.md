Check for available system updates and security patches:

1. Run `apt update` to refresh package lists (use sudo)
2. Check available upgrades with `apt list --upgradable`
3. Identify security updates specifically
4. Check if a system reboot is required (`/var/run/reboot-required`)
5. Review any held-back packages

Provide Daniel with:
- Number and list of available updates
- Any critical security updates
- Whether a reboot is needed
- Packages that are held back and why
- Recommendation on whether to proceed with updates now
- Estimated disk space required for updates
